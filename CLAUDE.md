# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Costco Travel Deal Watcher is a serverless Cloudflare Workers application that monitors Costco Travel URLs for promotional changes and sends Slack notifications when material changes are detected. The system runs on a cron schedule (every 3 hours) and provides admin APIs for manual target management and execution.

## Development Commands

### Core Development
- `npm run dev` - Start Wrangler development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript (uses `tsc`)
- `npm test` - Run all tests once using Vitest
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode for development

### Deployment
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to default (development) environment  
- `npm run deploy:dev` - Deploy to development environment
- `npm run deploy:prod` - Deploy to production environment

### Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Cloudflare account with Workers enabled
- Slack workspace with incoming webhook configured
- Node.js and npm installed locally

#### Production Deployment Steps

1. **Authenticate with Cloudflare:**
```bash
npx wrangler login
```

2. **Create KV Namespaces:**
```bash
# Create development namespace
npx wrangler kv namespace create "DEAL_WATCHER" --env development

# Create production namespace  
npx wrangler kv namespace create "DEAL_WATCHER" --env production
```

3. **Update wrangler.toml with real namespace IDs** from the create commands above.

4. **Set Production Secrets:**
```bash
# Generate secure admin token (store this safely!)
openssl rand -hex 32

# Set secrets for production environment
echo "your-generated-admin-token" | npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN --env production
echo "your-slack-webhook-url" | npx wrangler secret put SLACK_WEBHOOK --env production
```

5. **Deploy to Production:**
```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy --env production
```

#### Security Notes
- **Never commit secrets to git** - they are stored securely in Cloudflare
- **Build files (*.js) are excluded** from version control via .gitignore
- **Admin tokens should be stored in a password manager**
- **Slack webhooks should be rotated if compromised**

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Entry Point (`src/index.ts`)** - Main Cloudflare Worker with HTTP routing and scheduled event handling
2. **Target Processing (`src/target-processing.ts`)** - Core business logic for processing individual targets and batch operations
3. **KV Storage (`src/kv-storage.ts`)** - Data persistence layer managing targets, state, and historical snapshots
4. **Utilities (`src/utils.ts`)** - Shared functions for content fetching, HTML parsing, change detection, hashing, and Slack notifications
5. **Performance (`src/performance.ts`)** - Optimization utilities for monitoring and enhanced processing

### Data Flow

1. **Scheduled Execution**: Cron trigger ‚Üí `processBatchTargets()` ‚Üí parallel `processTarget()` for each enabled target
2. **Target Processing**: Fetch URL ‚Üí Parse HTML for promotions ‚Üí Compare with stored state ‚Üí Send notifications if changes detected ‚Üí Update state and history
3. **Admin API**: Authentication ‚Üí target CRUD operations ‚Üí manual batch execution

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Parallel Processing**: All targets processed concurrently with error isolation
- **Change Detection**: Content-based hashing with material change filtering (ignores minor text variations)
- **State Management**: Current state + historical snapshots with automatic pruning
- **Error Resilience**: Individual target failures don't affect batch processing; notification failures don't fail processing
- **Enhanced Content Analysis**: Advanced deal extraction with hotel names, locations, pricing, and package details
- **Rich Notifications**: Slack messages with structured deal information, emojis, and comprehensive summaries

### Storage Schema (KV)

- `targets` - Array of target configurations
- `state:<url-hash>` - Current state for each target (hash, promotions, timestamp)
- `hist:<url-hash>:<timestamp>` - Historical snapshots (auto-pruned to keep 5 most recent)

### API Endpoints

- `GET /healthz` - Health check
- `GET /admin/targets` - List all targets (requires ADMIN_TOKEN)
- `POST /admin/targets` - Create/update targets (requires ADMIN_TOKEN)
- `POST /admin/run` - Manual batch execution (requires ADMIN_TOKEN)
- `POST /admin/test-slack` - Test Slack webhook integration (requires ADMIN_TOKEN)
- `POST /admin/test-e2e` - End-to-end testing workflow for URL monitoring (requires ADMIN_TOKEN)

### Current Monitoring Configuration

The system is currently configured to monitor the following targets:

**Active Targets:**
1. **Kauai: 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay Package**
   - URL: `https://www.costcotravel.com/Vacation-Packages/Offers/HAWLIH1HOTELHANALEIBAY20230309`
   - Monitors: Promotional package deals, resort credits, special offers
   - Selector: `.deal-info, .package-details, .offer-details, .promo-info, .price, .resort-credit`

2. **Kauai: 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay - Hotel Rates**
   - URL: `https://www.costcotravel.com/Hotels/Hawaii/Kauai/Kauai1HotelHanaleiBay`
   - Monitors: General hotel room rates and availability
   - Selector: `.deal-info, .package-details, .offer-details, .promo-info, .price, .rate, .hotel-rate`

### Target Management

**Add/Update Targets:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-admin-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "targets": [
      {
        "url": "https://www.costcotravel.com/your-target-url",
        "name": "Your Target Name",
        "enabled": true,
        "selector": ".promo, .deal-info, .price, .discount",
        "notes": "Optional description of what this target monitors"
      }
    ]
  }' \
  https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/admin/targets
```

**List Current Targets:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-admin-token" \
  https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/admin/targets
```

**Manual Execution:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-admin-token" \
  https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/admin/run
```

### Testing and Debugging

**Test Slack Integration:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-admin-token" \
  https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/admin/test-slack
```

**End-to-End URL Testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-admin-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.costcotravel.com/any-url-to-test"}' \
  https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/admin/test-e2e
```

The E2E endpoint provides detailed content analysis including:
- **Deal extraction**: Hotel names, packages, pricing, savings
- **Location identification**: Destinations and resort locations  
- **Rich Slack formatting**: Comprehensive deal summaries with emojis
- **Debug output**: Console logging for development and troubleshooting

### Content Analysis Features

The system includes advanced content extraction capabilities:

**Deal Detection Patterns:**
- Hotel and resort names (Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, Ritz-Carlton, etc.)
- Location extraction (Hawaii, Las Vegas, Caribbean, Europe, etc.)
- Pricing information ($150, $1,260, "from $536", etc.)
- Savings amounts ("Save $300", "50% off", etc.)
- Package details (resort credits, waived fees, stay 4/pay 3, etc.)
- Date information (booking deadlines, travel dates, etc.)

**Content Cleaning:**
- HTML entity decoding (&#x27; ‚Üí ', &nbsp; ‚Üí space)
- Text artifact removal (navigation elements, partial words)
- Title extraction with natural language breaks
- Price context analysis (per night, per person, package total)

**Slack Notification Format:**
- üéØ Deal count and summary
- üí∞ Pricing with context  
- üí∏ Savings amounts
- üìç Location information
- üìÖ Date restrictions
- üìù Package descriptions
- Rich formatting with headers, dividers, and context sections

## Development Notes

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: All modules have corresponding `.test.ts` files
- **Integration Tests**: Worker entry point and admin API endpoints
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of core business logic, error handling, and edge cases

### Authentication
Admin endpoints use Bearer token authentication with constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.

### Performance Considerations
- HTMLRewriter used for efficient HTML parsing without full DOM construction
- Parallel target processing with configurable batch sizes
- KV operations optimized with proper key generation and pruning strategies
- Content normalization to reduce false positives in change detection

### Environment Configuration
The project supports development and production environments with separate KV namespaces. Configuration is managed through `wrangler.toml` with environment-specific overrides.
